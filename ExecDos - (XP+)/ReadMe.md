It executes any console program and immediately returns its output or error output to the script, if the executed program returns any. There are separate functions to catch the output and error output, so you will know if it comes from output or errors output of the executed program.

It returns true if successfully executed, false otherwise. It waits for the program end, and it will returns executed program exit-code after the program closed.
