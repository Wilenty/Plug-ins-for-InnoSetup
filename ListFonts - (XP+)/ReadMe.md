This example allows you to check my plug-in for listing installed fonts from the OS. And it uses the "CallbackCtrl.dll", because this version of InnoSetup does not have the "CreateCallback" function...

You can query the fonts by its char-set or type, or even the quality. But, it takes a while of the time to process all the font properties for display (on the ListBox), so please be patient.
