With this dialog you can select any local or remote folder/location (I replaced default browse for folder dialog in this example on the "Select destination page"):
Microsoft "tells" on their support website that this dialog works from Windows Vista, but I see it also works on Windows XP:
So, before decide to use this plugin, you should check if it works on the OS you want.
