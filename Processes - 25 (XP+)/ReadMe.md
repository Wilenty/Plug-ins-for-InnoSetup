This example installs and executes "cmd.exe" ("cmd.exe" 64-bit and/or 32-bit) {taken from Windows XP64}. It checks if the programs are running from install path and asks you to close them, otherwise the installer will not allow you to move on, when install and uninstall. It's much better way that internal InnoSetup function to manage running program processes, about which you don't have any control...

Functions to close all processes from given path won't allows you to close all processes from it, if the path is system location, as for example: "C:\Program Files", "C:\Program Files (x86)", "C:\Windows", "C:\Windows\System32" and "C:\Windows\SysWOW64". But it works if the given location is inside above mentioned folders. It's a protection so you don't close important system processes. Anyway you can find your processes and close them by separate functions.
